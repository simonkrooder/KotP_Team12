Immediate Actions\\n\\n- Suspend further salary changes for user u001 until clarification and proper authorization are obtained.\\n- Escalate the case to the HR Controller (as indicated by your request to send an email) for urgent review and intervention.\\n- If possible, restrict u001’s access to self-modify critical HR fields pending investigation outcome.\\n\\n2. Documentation & Audit\\n\\n- Ensure all audit logs related to this and similar changes are preserved and reviewed for additional suspicious activity.\\n- Once user u001 responds, verify the justification and check for any supporting documentation or prior approvals.\\n\\n3. Policy & Compliance\\n\\n- Review company policy regarding self-authorization for salary changes. Typically, such changes should require multi-level approval and should not be permitted by the affected user.\\n- Update or reinforce controls to prevent users from modifying their own compensation without oversight.\\n\\n4. Authorization Data\\n\\n- Locate or restore the missing authorizations.csv or equivalent authorization data to validate whether u001 ever had rights to perform this action.\\n- If the file is missing due to a system issue, initiate an IT review to recover or reconstruct the necessary access control records.\\n\\n5. Communication\\n\\n- Keep all relevant stakeholders (HR, IT Security, Internal Audit, and Legal if necessary) informed of the ongoing investigation and any interim actions taken.\\n- Document all steps and communications for compliance and future audit purposes.\\n\\nSummary for Controller Email\\n\\nA significant, unauthorized salary increase was performed by user u001 for themselves in the HRProd environment.
