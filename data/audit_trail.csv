Immediate Actions\\n\\n- Suspend further salary changes for user u001 until clarification and proper authorization are obtained.\\n- Escalate the case to the HR Controller (as indicated by your request to send an email) for urgent review and intervention.\\n- If possible, restrict u001’s access to self-modify critical HR fields pending investigation outcome.\\n\\n2. Documentation & Audit\\n\\n- Ensure all audit logs related to this and similar changes are preserved and reviewed for additional suspicious activity.\\n- Once user u001 responds, verify the justification and check for any supporting documentation or prior approvals.\\n\\n3. Policy & Compliance\\n\\n- Review company policy regarding self-authorization for salary changes. Typically, such changes should require multi-level approval and should not be permitted by the affected user.\\n- Update or reinforce controls to prevent users from modifying their own compensation without oversight.\\n\\n4. Authorization Data\\n\\n- Locate or restore the missing authorizations.csv or equivalent authorization data to validate whether u001 ever had rights to perform this action.\\n- If the file is missing due to a system issue, initiate an IT review to recover or reconstruct the necessary access control records.\\n\\n5. Communication\\n\\n- Keep all relevant stakeholders (HR, IT Security, Internal Audit, and Legal if necessary) informed of the ongoing investigation and any interim actions taken.\\n- Document all steps and communications for compliance and future audit purposes.\\n\\nSummary for Controller Email\\n\\nA significant, unauthorized salary increase was performed by user u001 for themselves in the HRProd environment. Authorization could not be confirmed due to missing access data. Clarification has been requested from the user, but no response has been received yet. Immediate action is recommended to suspend further changes, review access controls, and escalate for urgent review.\\n\\nWould you like a formal report or template for communicating with the HR Controller or other stakeholders?
