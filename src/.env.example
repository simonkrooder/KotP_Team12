# For developer authentication, you can rely on DefaultAzureCredential which supports
# environment-based credentials (e.g., AZURE_CLIENT_ID, AZURE_TENANT_ID, AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET)
# or managed identity when running in Azure.
# Example client credentials (only use for local dev and never commit real secrets):
# AZURE_CLIENT_ID=your-client-id
# AZURE_TENANT_ID=your-tenant-id
# AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET=your-client-secret
